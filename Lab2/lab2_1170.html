    <h1>EDUCATION IN BRITISH COLUMBIA</h1>
    <p>British Columbiaâ€™s schools are among the best in the world. The cost of studying here is lower than in many other locations. We offer exceptional elementary and secondary schools. Our universities and post-secondary institutions are known world-wide. We offer support for international students and for those wishing to learn English as a second language.</p>
    
    <h2>Preschool</h2>
    <p>Many schools offer free programs to help children between three and five years of age prepare for school. Children learn important skills, and parents get information about how to help their children learn.</p>
    
    <h2>Kindergarten to Grade 12</h2>
    <p>In British Columbia, all children between the ages of six and 16 must go to school or they can study at home. Most children who live in B.C. can go to a public school for free, go to a private independent school, or study at home.</p>
